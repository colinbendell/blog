While IE7 has been released there are still many users who have IE6 (and even 5.5) running on their desktops. With [Multiple-IE](http://tredosoft.com/Multiple_IE) you can install stand alone versions of IE6 through IE3 on your desktop without the bulk of a Virtual Server image. This will let you easily test IE7 and IE6 simultaneously.

(While you are at it, you should also install [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/) to test the usability for the other [13-18% of users](http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp))
