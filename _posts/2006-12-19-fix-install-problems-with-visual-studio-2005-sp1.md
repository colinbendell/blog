There is a quick fix if your install of VS 2005 SP1 fails with a message to the effect that `the digital certificate cannot be verified`. Please follow the instructions in [kb925336](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/925336). Unfortunately you'll have to restart a couple of times in order to complete the install. 

Yay.
