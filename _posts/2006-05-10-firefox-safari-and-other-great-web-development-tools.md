Moleskin has, yet another, [list of very useful webdevelopment extensions](http://www.themoleskin.com/archives/10-firefox-extensions-for-web-development/) for firefox. I don't know how I lived without some of these extensions!

And, on the topic of web development, [SafariTest](http://www.snugtech.com/safaritest/) is a great tool which lets you see how your web page would look in Safari (OSX). They've even got a [public test server](http://www.snugtech.com/blog/) that you can login and use (via VNC) to test Safari.
