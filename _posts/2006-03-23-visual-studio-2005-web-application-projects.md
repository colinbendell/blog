Microsoft has updated the addin: [VS2005 Web Application Projects](http://msdn.microsoft.com/asp.net/reference/infrastructure/wap/default.aspx). This will allow you to create web applications that behave more like they did in VS2003 (so you don't have to use the VS2005 'Website' project).

Features include:
* compilation to single assembly in the \bin folder
* project file that contains all files related to the project (allows you to hide files)
* allows direct migration from vs2003 web applications

Update: Here's an alternate [download](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=8b05ee00-9554-4733-8725-3ca89dd9bfca&displaylang=en). I'm not sure what the difference is though.
