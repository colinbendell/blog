Today is [World Usability Day](http://www.worldusabilityday.org/about)! From their website:

>"Why doesn't this work right? What am I supposed to do with this now?"

>World Usability Day, November 14, 2006, is for everyone who's ever asked these questions. This Earth Day style event, focused on raising awareness and visibility of usability engineering and user centered design, is currently being organized by volunteers and local event coordinators from around the world. Whether a usability professional or just an enthusiastic (or frustrated) user, each participant is making a contribution to "making life easy".

To commemorate this day, MS has a few lessons to teach us with their recent product, Zune. We will title this lesson "[Why Usability, and QA testing are important (aka Installing the Zune sucked)](http://www.engadget.com/2006/11/13/installing-the-zune-sucked/)."
